# `kmx` — agent tooling with Orka as the default

[Orka](orka.md) remains the first-class platform and the default for every
existing workflow. Kaimahi's front door is `kmx orka` for installation/status,
`kmx agent create` for native Provider + Agent authoring, and `kmx migrate` for
an existing application's **model traffic**. The Deployment remains
owner-managed. Installing Orka alone is not this migration; none of these
operations silently governs application tools.

The former broad Kagent integration is not restored. Its installer steps,
manifests, chat, list/show/status, lift/evaluate, console, quickstart, `up`, and
AKS payload remain absent or retired. The only current capability is explicit
`kmx agent create --runtime kagent <name>` against an already-installed exact
Kagent v0.10.2. Historical lift records remain readable for teardown only.
Governance, preset switching and agent editing remain retired; hidden command
stubs guide old callers to supported replacements. `orka.harness.v2` is outside
the direction.
A shrinking compatibility/governance bridge is success, not a reason to rebuild
Orka's platform in Kaimahi.

## Install

The stable release is available through the official Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install kaimahi-agents/tap/kmx &&
  kmx_prefix="$(brew --prefix kaimahi-agents/tap/kmx)" &&
  "$kmx_prefix/bin/kmx" version
```

The fully qualified formula trusts only `kmx`. Homebrew installs the CLI, not
Docker, Podman or Go; local kind still needs a container engine, and `kmx plane`
still needs Go. To build the same release with Go 1.26+ instead:

```bash
go install github.com/kaimahi-agents/kaimahi/cmd/kmx@v0.4.0
kmx version
kmx orka --help
```

Ensure Go's binary directory is on PATH. `@latest` follows the newest tagged
release; `@main` remains a moving development revision. From a checkout,
`make` builds `bin/kmx` and prints its path without changing a cluster; use
that binary to exercise edits.

Alternatively, use the checksum-verified release installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaimahi-agents/kaimahi/main/install.sh | sh
```

That installer puts the selected release in `~/.local/bin`, without sudo;
`--version=v0.4.0` pins it, `--bin-dir=DIR` changes the destination, and
`--quickstart` continues into `kmx quickstart`. A new shell may need
`~/.local/bin` on `PATH`, or invoke `$HOME/.local/bin/kmx` directly. It checks the binary against
a checksum from the **same** GitHub release over TLS: corruption detection, not
an independent signature. See [releases](releases.md) for platforms and upgrades.

Local kind commands need Docker or Podman. kmx uses kind and kubectl from
PATH first, otherwise fetches pinned, checksum-verified tools, including
Helm 3 for Orka's v0.2.0 chart. Helm calls pin the selected Kubernetes context
with `--kube-context`. No Orka runtime CLI is fetched or cached. Cached digests are
rechecked before reuse. Set
`KMX_TOOLCHAIN=off` to refuse missing tools instead. No container engine or Azure
CLI is installed for you. `kmx plane` outside a checkout needs Go to fetch/build
its source; the lift plane phase preflights Go even from a checkout.

Docker remains the default for compatibility. Podman is a first-class explicit
choice:

```bash
kmx --container-engine podman quickstart
```

The global flag works before or after a subcommand and overrides
`CONTAINER_ENGINE=...`. kmx deliberately does not fall back between live daemons:
Docker and Podman have separate kind inventories and can each own a same-named
cluster, so a silent switch can target the wrong one.

## Commands

Use `kmx --help` and `kmx <command> --help` for flags and defaults. The Cobra tree
also generates completion; this guide describes contracts rather than duplicating
every flag. Command definitions are in [`cmd/kmx`](../cmd/kmx).

### Current Orka path and explicit Kagent create

| Command | Contract / reference |
|---|---|
| `kmx orka install` | verify the pinned v0.2.0 release chart; apply its CRDs; install harness-v2 with fullname `orka-api` on the selected context; keep the chart-generated snapshot key private; optionally create a keyless Provider. Refuses old v0.1.3 installs rather than upgrading. [Orka](orka.md) |
| `kmx orka status` | read running controller version, Deployments, CRDs and Providers; distinguish unreadable from absent and running version from pin |
| `kmx agent create [name]` | default, unchanged Orka authoring: native Provider + Agent and optional Task. Explicit `--runtime kagent <name>` is create-only for an already-installed exact Kagent v0.10.2. Retrieve a real answer only with `--task`. [Create contract](#kmx-agent-create) |
| `kmx agent lift <bundle-dir>` | reconcile an existing Orka portable bundle on a prepared destination; Kagent bundles are refused before target reads. `--plan` checks without writing. [Bundle lift](agent-lift.md) |
| `kmx agent retire <bundle-dir>` | delete or release bundle-owned Orka resources after UID, receipt and dependent checks; Kagent bundles are refused before target reads. `--plan` checks without writing. [Bundle retirement](agent-lift.md#retiring-a-bundle-from-a-target) |
| `kmx agent status <bundle-dir>` | compare an Orka portable Git revision with each recorded target's live Provider and Agent, readiness, drift and evaluation result; Kagent bundles are refused. `--to-context` selects one target, `-o json` emits structured facts. [Bundle status](agent-lift.md#checking-deployed-status) |
| `kmx agent evaluate <bundle-dir>` | run an Orka bundle's `eval/*.yaml` cases as one Task each against the deployed revision, only when it carries the bundle's current portable digest; Kagent bundles are refused. Print answers, write a receipt with answer digests (never text), exit non-zero unless every case passed. [Bundle evaluation](agent-lift.md#evaluating-a-deployed-revision) |
| `kmx agent run <bundle-dir> --prompt <text>` / `kmx agent run --agent <name> --prompt-file <path>` | execute one Task against an already-deployed Orka Agent without changing the bundle; stdout is answer-only. `--runtime agentsessions --server <address>` instead runs a compatible local bundle through an existing AgentSessions host. Supports `--prompt-file -` for stdin and `--wait` (default 5m, maximum 9m). [Running an existing Agent](agent-lift.md#running-an-existing-agent) |
| `kmx suite inspect <suite-dir-or-oci-layout>` | incubation POC: strictly resolve local source or verify a packaged OCI layout, compute immutable member and suite identities, and display declared aggregation separately from a read-only AgentSessions/Substrate lift plan |
| `kmx suite package <suite-dir> --output <dir>` | export the resolved suite, exact `suite.yaml`, and exact portable member documents as a deterministic OCI Image Layout artifact without credentials or runtime state |
| `kmx suite run <suite-dir> --server <address> --prompt <text>` | run each declared specialist as its own durable AgentSessions/Substrate session, suspend it after its output commits, then run the coordinator with those recorded outputs to produce answer-only aggregation. Sessions share suite/run identity annotations but retain independent member digests |
| `kmx task result <task> [--context <ctx>] [--namespace <ns>] [--wait 5m]` | inspect an AI Task's phase once by default and open a result session only for a readable terminal answer; `--wait <duration>` waits 10s–9m and reports phase changes. Pending or not-yet-readable results exit 2; failed or cancelled Tasks exit 1. [Running an existing Agent](agent-lift.md#running-an-existing-agent) |
| `kmx migrate <deployment>` | inspect workload/Provider; create seam identity and ingress; mint/reconcile credentials; write the owner-applied patch. [Migration](migrate.md) |
| `kmx ctx [context]` | show target/source/posture or remember a target in kmx's config directory |
| `kmx console` | two-column local/remote workspace for native Orka Agents, with Vim/arrow navigation, agent actions, inference details and slash-command completion; Kagent inventory and bundles are unsupported. `b` compares the selected Orka agent with its local bundle using the same report as `kmx agent status`; `--demo` uses sample data. [Console guide](interactive-agent-tui-plan.md) |

### Existing plane and operator commands

These are the present seam implementation, including the bridge used by migrate.

| Command | Contract / reference |
|---|---|
| `kmx plane` | image, secrets, certificate, deployment; `--step` runs one of those steps; `--source` selects checkout or fetch |
| `kmx credentials` / `kmx credential renew <name>` | list expiries / extend deadline without changing token material. [Identity](identity.md) |
| `kmx credential issue <name>` | require exactly one destination: `--secret <name>` with the `--namespace <ns>` it lands in (no default — the namespace is named, never guessed) or `--discard` to discard the one-time bearer; never print the bearer. A namespace that does not exist is refused before the token is minted |
| `kmx models credential copilot` | native device-login/exchange into plane custody; applies egress and restarts an existing proxy |
| `kmx ledger [credential]` | newest model rows plus month-to-date totals; defaults to `$CRED` |
| `kmx flow [credential]` | model ledger, oldest first; all credentials by default; **timeline, not causal trace** |
| `kmx watch [credential]` | model ledger rows **as they happen**, appended one line per event, with denials marked. Append-only rather than full-screen, so the scrollback survives and the feed pipes into `grep`. Starts from now — `--replay N` prints recent history first. A failed read prints a gap that says it is **not** an absence of activity, and a watch that cannot recover exits non-zero rather than going quiet (`--interval`, `--limit`, `--for`, `--replay`, `--json`) |
| `kmx budget [credential]` | replace monthly caps; **no cap flags clears both**; `0` is a valid cap |
| `kmx models add <name>` | reviewable model upstream/NetworkPolicy onboarding; contract below |
| `kmx backup [file]` / `kmx restore <file>` / `kmx metrics` | database backup/replacement / one replica's counters; contracts below |
| `kmx completion bash\|zsh\|fish` / `kmx version` | shell completion / binary and dependency versions |

Custom request/approval/grant commands and APIs, including approval audit, are
removed, following tool-governance/capture, workflow, inbound and notification
retirement. Historical SQL/data remain accessible through SQL/backups, not those
APIs. `flow`/`watch` read only the model ledger. Ordinary `budget` and credential
operations remain. Admin contract 5 marks this breaking removal, not compatibility
negotiation: **upgrade CLI and plane together**. See the
[upgrade procedure](operations.md#upgrading-after-approval-retirement), including
old-replica and rollback risks; older installations also need gateway cleanup.

Credential issuance/renewal TTL remains 60 seconds–365 days.

### Runtime commands

| Command | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| `kmx quickstart` | kind + keyless Ollama + pinned Orka v0.2.0 Helm chart + the fixed `hello-world-agent` Orka bundle + a fresh Task with a readable answer; no Kagent installation or plane/governance enabled. [Getting started](getting-started.md#one-command-and-an-agent-that-answers) |
| `kmx quickstart-wizard` | Experimental TUI: author an Orka agent while kind, Ollama/model, and Orka start in the background; then validate, apply, and optionally run its first Task. |
| `kmx up` | the runtime and no agent: cluster, ollama, model, orka. `--step` selects exactly one of those four; the three legacy steps are removed and are refused as unknown |
| `kmx aks up` / `kmx aks down` | Provision AKS and land Orka on it, then clean up owned resources. `--payload` defaults to `orka` and is the only payload (no Provider is created); the legacy payload is refused as retired, and an existing legacy lift can still be inspected and torn down. The deprecated `kmx lift` / `kmx lift down` still work; `kmx lift` still requires `--payload`. [AKS](aks.md) |
| `kmx agent list` | Orka Agents in one namespace: readiness, Provider and resolved model. `--namespace <ns>` selects it and defaults to `orka-system`; table/JSON/YAML |
| `kmx agent show <name>` | one Orka Agent and the chain it depends on: Provider readiness, the Secret the Provider names (**presence only — the value is never read**), the model actually resolved, the tools including disabled ones, and recent Tasks. Requires `--namespace`, because Orka watches namespaces explicitly. An unread hop is reported `unknown`, never as absent (`--namespace`, `--output table\|json`, `--tasks`) |
| `kmx agent chat --interactive <name>` | interactive Orka session (`--runtime auto\|orka`, `--namespace`, default `orka-system`). Orka chat is a session, so a one-shot invocation is refused and names this command; Kagent chat is not restored by its create capability |
| `kmx status` | Starts with the unchanged `kmx orka status` report (running version, deployments, CRDs, Provider readiness), then reports the separate model plane's readiness and seam certificate expiry with the same pinned context. An absent, unreadable, or scaled-zero plane is reported distinctly. `-o table` only |
| `kmx down` | delete named kind cluster, **including its ledger** |

`quickstart` reuses an **exact** live match of the Provider and Agent it would
write, and nothing else: a differing spec is somebody's deliberate change, so
it refuses rather than overwrite it, and a half-finished run resumes. Every run
creates a **fresh** Task — reporting an existing completed Task's answer would
turn "the agent answered" into "the agent answered once, some time ago". The
result must be non-blank after sanitisation. These are not read-only
operations: other setup steps still reconcile. Old gateway tool references on
a cluster require an explicit owner decision, not a silent switch to direct
access.

## Settings

| Setting | Meaning / default |
|---|---|
| `--context`, `KUBE_CTX`, `kmx ctx` | explicit invocation, environment or remembered target; kmx does not follow changing kubectl current-context |
| `KIND_CLUSTER` | kind container cluster name, default `kaimahi-p1`; pick your own for isolated work |
| `--container-engine`, `CONTAINER_ENGINE` | `docker` (default) or `podman`; the flag overrides the environment; keep consistent for every operation on a cluster |
| `MODEL` | model the runtime pulls and resolves, default `qwen2.5:3b` |
| `CHAT_PORT`, `ADMIN_PORT`, `OPS_PORT` | automatic chat port; fixed admin `19091`, ops `19092` |
| `CRED` | default model/operator credential `hello-world` |
| `KAIMAHI_CONFIRM` | explicit named-target consent, not a universal yes |
| `KMX_HOME` | portable override for all kmx state/cache; otherwise the native user config directory (`~/.config/kmx` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/kmx` on macOS) |

Use `KMX_HOME` for isolated runs and tests on both Linux and macOS. KMX follows
Go's native user-config lookup when it is unset: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` participates
in that lookup on Linux, but it is not the macOS override. Changing `KMX_HOME`
selects a separate set of saved records; it does not migrate files from the
native location. Point it only at a trusted private directory: KMX state can
include kubeconfig snapshots and infrastructure resource identifiers.

### Where the command will land

Mutations print context, who chose it, server and namespaces on stderr. Local
kind requires both a kind-shaped name and loopback server; remote mutations
require typed confirmation or `KAIMAHI_CONFIRM=<context>`. Non-interactive runs
without consent refuse. Read-only reports do not prompt.

The implicit `kind-kaimahi-p1` fallback refuses when kubeconfig contains other
possible targets and nobody chose this one. An empty machine, or corroboration
that the fallback is already current, permits first setup. Current-context is
never substituted as kmx's target. Kind creation/image loading also require
context `kind-$KIND_CLUSTER`; confirmation cannot override that mismatch.

`kmx down` checks the container engine because kind deletes by container name,
not kubeconfig. A listed kind cluster missing from kubeconfig requires explicit
named confirmation; no matching container cluster is a no-op. An absent context
is not proof there is nothing to delete.

Lift has cloud-specific consent: creation/BYO lift confirms cluster; created
teardown confirms **resource group**, BYO teardown confirms **cluster**. Consent
precedes deletion, including recorded resources outside the group. BYO removes
recorded monitoring, not agents/plane; unknown ownership is left alone. Read
[AKS ownership and teardown](aks.md#teardown), not just the exit status.

## Output contracts

- On capable terminals, reports use rich headings and responsive tables. Wide
  tables become labelled records. Full identifiers/digests and exact numbers
  remain available. `TERM=dumb` chooses plain; non-empty `NO_COLOR` removes ANSI
  but keeps static rich report layout. Chat additionally disables cursor effects
  and enhanced input under `NO_COLOR`.
- Redirected admin reports retain fixed-width/truncated compatibility output.
  Progress/diagnostics go to stderr. JSON/YAML, manifests, metrics, completion,
  SQL and raw chat bypass styling. Admin JSON/YAML is not implemented.
- Chat is a session and has no one-shot form: a non-interactive invocation is
  refused and names the command that works, so there are no task bytes to pipe
  and no `--json` chat output. `--interactive --json` is refused too.
- Quickstart JSON has keys `ok`, `context`, `cluster`, `agent`, `manifest`,
  `question`, `answer`, `governed`, `tools`, `elapsed_seconds`, `next`. `tools` is
  null when none were provisioned. `governed: false` means **this invocation did
  not enable governance**, not that existing governance is absent. Success
  requires a completed task with a readable answer; stdout is one JSON document.
- `status` has no `-o json|yaml`, and refuses them by name rather than printing
  an empty document. The structured output counted the legacy runtime's
  Agents and model presets; nothing replaces that count, because `kmx migrate` routes the
  owner's own workloads and kmx cannot enumerate them. Read the cluster
  directly for machine-readable runtime facts.
- Ledger caller claims are unverified client assertions; observed source
  addresses and `acted for` are separate fields. Flow counts model refusals from
  `cost_source: denied`, not from any upstream HTTP error. Configuration posture
  is not proof a specific request crossed a seam.

Completion (`source <(kmx completion bash)`, similarly zsh; fish uses
`kmx completion fish | source`) performs bounded read-only lookups for contexts
and agents, no guard/download/forward/mutation. Static completion works offline.

## `kmx agent create`

Orka remains the default. Omitting `--runtime`, or passing `--runtime orka`,
retains the existing bytes, calls, wizard, flags, and behavior. Kagent is
explicit-only: `kmx agent create --runtime kagent <name>`. Runtime selection is
independent of `--provider-type`, which selects the model provider used by that
runtime.

### Default Orka contract

Every default Orka bundle contains a new, same-name Provider and referencing
Agent in `core.orka.ai/v1alpha1`, a metadata-only Secret skeleton, and optionally
a fresh Task. It does not install Orka or adopt the installer's shared Provider.
Start with the [first-Task guide](orka.md#author-an-orka-agent-and-get-an-answer)
for a context-pinned local run, separately provisioned result account, and the
release/main authorization and connection limits.

For offline preview, without tools, kubeconfig reads or cluster calls:

```bash
kmx agent create preview --namespace orka-system \
  --provider-type openai --model qwen2.5:3b --secret local-provider-key \
  --base-url http://ollama.ollama.svc.cluster.local:11434/v1 --out -
```

Namespace, Provider type (`openai|anthropic|azure-openai`), actual model ID and existing Secret
name are explicit inputs; `--secret-key` defaults to `api-key`. These are names,
not credential values. For native Azure OpenAI, set `--azure-deployment` to the
same value as `--model` and `--base-url` to the HTTPS resource root (for example,
`https://example.openai.azure.com`, **not** `/openai/v1`). Orka v0.2.0 validates
`Provider.spec.azure.deploymentName`, but its request client addresses the
Azure deployment using the effective model name. kmx therefore requires them
to match when authoring; a Task-level model override can still target another
deployment. Use `--provider-type openai` instead for the v1-compatible
`/openai/v1` endpoint. `--azure-api-version` is optional; if omitted, kmx leaves
the field out, but the Orka CRD can default it on apply. We recommend setting
`--azure-api-version` explicitly for predictable runtime behavior.

The key file must contain **only the key, with no trailing newline**. Orka
does not trim it: the Provider can be Ready while every Task fails because the
key contains a line ending. In Bash or Zsh, this context-pinned command removes
LF and CRLF line endings without putting the key on the command line or printing it:

```bash
kubectl --context <ctx> -n <ns> create secret generic <name> \
  --from-file=api-key=<(tr -d '\r\n' < <path>)
kmx --context <ctx> agent create my-azure-agent --namespace <ns> \
  --provider-type azure-openai --model <deployment> --azure-deployment <deployment> \
  --azure-api-version <version> --base-url https://example.openai.azure.com \
  --secret <name>
```

The key stays in the file and the existing namespaced Secret; kmx accepts only
the Secret name/key reference, not key bytes or a key-file flag.
`--instructions` reads a system-prompt file; `--tools` and `--skills` name Orka
references on this default Orka path, not Kagent `server:tool` selections or translated
MCP wiring. `--coordination` requires at least one repeatable `--allowed-agent
<name>`; both go in the portable Orka extension. Edit the bundle for optional
delegation limits ([bundle format](agent-lift.md#coordination-in-agentyaml)). Use
`kmx agent create --help` for all flags and defaults.

- `--out -` prints rendered YAML only and implies offline; it writes no files
  unless `--bundle-path` explicitly names a bundle directory. `--no-apply`
  writes an exclusive local rendered artifact. Default artifact file:
  `agents/<name>.yaml`. An existing rendered artifact is never overwritten:
  an applying create keeps one that is byte-identical to what it renders and
  refuses, naming the file, one that differs; offline and `--dry-run` refuse any
  existing file. Input and final YAML reject known credential shapes.
- When the rendered artifact is written to a file (online creation, offline
  `--no-apply`, or online `--dry-run`), kmx also writes a Git-friendly agent
  bundle at `agents/<name>/` by default, or at `--bundle-path <directory>`.
  `agent.yaml` contains the portable behavior revision (name, description,
  instructions, model, Orka tools, skills and rate limits); `bindings.yaml`
  records **only the creation target** (namespace, Provider type and endpoint,
  Azure deployment/optional API version when applicable, Secret name/key reference,
  never a value). A future lift will obtain other
  targets' bindings from its flags and kmx's local state, not additional bundle
  files. A new bundle also gets one example evaluation case,
  `eval/example.yaml`, for [`kmx agent evaluate`](agent-lift.md#evaluating-a-deployed-revision);
  cases are not part of the portable digest, and a rerun accepts any `eval/`
  directory.
  The portable digest covers the **exact bytes** of `agent.yaml`: even changing
  a comment or whitespace creates a new revision by design. Target bindings
  do not change it; rendered YAML and its digest do reflect them. A rerun can
  reuse an existing byte-identical bundle; if either file differs, creation
  refuses and names the differing file. A failed deploy leaves the bundle and
  the rendered artifact for retry, and **rerunning the same command is safe**:
  both are kept when identical, and the cluster side reconciles as below.
  With `--task` the rendered Task name is random, so the old artifact can never
  match: a `--task` rerun refuses it and needs a new `--out` path.
- Offline defaults to `--schema-target v0.2.0`. Explicit
  `--schema-target v0.1.3|main` retains [pinned CRD fixtures](../internal/kmx/orkaschema/README.md)
  for legacy reads/authoring and the immutable old main snapshot, **not**
  install targets or a network fetch. Unknown fields refuse; v0.2.0 and the
  pinned old main snapshot lack Agent/Provider rate limits and refuse those
  flags rather than dropping fields. Select `v0.1.3` explicitly to inspect
  old manifests; that does not make a v0.1.3 runtime installable by kmx.
  Offline schema validation is not CEL/admission, readiness or execution proof.
- Online uses installed CRDs with **no fixture fallback**, checks Secret/key
  presence and ownership, and strictly server-dry-runs each custom resource.
  `--dry-run` writes the local artifact but no cluster resources, token or forward;
  it tests neither result access nor execution and cannot be combined with offline modes.
- **Never write the Secret skeleton or bulk-apply the bundle.** Provision the
  referenced key separately through your secret-management path. kmx never creates,
  replaces or merges that Secret. Online creation never uses apply:
  Provider → current-generation Ready → Agent → current-generation Ready → optional
  Task. Provider and Agent are reconciled as `kmx agent lift` does
  ([ownership](agent-lift.md)): created with the bundle's ownership markers,
  reused or updated (under a resourceVersion precondition) when they carry them,
  adopted when unmarked but identical, and refused otherwise — both are
  inspected before the first write. The optional Task is always newly created,
  never reused or resubmitted. For manual creation split out only those custom
  resources and preserve that order and the UID/generation readiness checks,
  using an explicit context and namespace. Failures leave partial state and
  nothing is rolled back; the error says so, and a rerun reuses what it wrote.
- `--task` authorizes a model call and requires an existing
  `--result-service-account` in the selected namespace; `agent create` creates no
  account or RBAC. (`kmx up --step orka` provisions `orka-result-reader`, whose
  grant is one verb on `tasks.core.orka.ai` in `orka-system`.) It creates the
  Task once and waits for Succeeded plus an actual nonblank
  answer. **Without `--task`, no model response was tested.**
- kmx requests a ten-minute token; **the API server determines its actual TTL**.
  It carries the account's full effective authority, not result-only scope;
  discarding it is not revocation. The historical v0.1.3 release did not
  enforce Task-read RBAC; the pinned old main snapshot requires namespaced
  Task-get. Do not use that history to infer v0.2.0 enforcement; keep the
  namespaced grant. Result bytes are not bound to a UID.
  The context-pinned loopback HTTP forward uses one TCP connection and stops on
  connection/forward loss, never redialing or resubmitting. This trades reconnect
  availability for protection against later local-port reuse; initial connection
  trust is still local. See the [full limits](orka.md#author-an-orka-agent-and-get-an-answer).

No-name terminal use offers a wizard for missing required inputs and explicit
Apply/Cancel; Escape/Ctrl-C cancel without writing. `TERM=dumb` uses linear
prompts. Non-interactive use requires a name. No agent name is reserved: the
embedded examples that occupied `hello-world` and `hello-tools` are gone.

`--image`, `--isolation` and `--run-as-user` are removed. There is no BYO image
scaffold, model-preset/MCP conversion, injected governance or copied legacy pod
hardening. Keep application image/placement/identity in the owner's Deployment;
[migration](migrate.md) routes its model traffic, not a BYO definition. This
native implementation does not settle the open authoring-format decision or
promote the isolated conversion spike to a supported interface.

### Explicit Kagent v0.10.2 create

This is a narrow lifecycle adapter for **render and create only**. It targets an
already-installed exact Kagent v0.10.2; KMX never installs, upgrades, repairs,
or otherwise manages Kagent. It does not change the default runtime or restore
Kagent chat, list, show, status, lift, evaluate, console, interactive `/lift`,
quickstart, `up`, installer, or AKS payload support. Old AKS lift records remain
teardown-only.

An offline review needs no cluster, kubeconfig read, or tool on `PATH`:

```bash
kmx agent create reviewer --runtime kagent --namespace agents \
  --description 'Reviews changes' --provider-type openai \
  --model gpt-4o-mini --secret reviewer-key \
  --instructions instructions.txt --out -
```

`--out -` implies `--no-apply` and writes the review artifact to stdout. Add
`--bundle-path agents/reviewer` to retain the portable bundle when using stdout;
otherwise file output and `--no-apply` use `agents/<name>.yaml` and
`agents/<name>/` by default. The artifact contains, in review order, a
metadata-only Secret skeleton, ModelConfig, and Agent, including the Agent's
reviewed system instructions. Never apply the Secret
skeleton or bulk-apply the artifact. The bundle contains a strict portable
`agent.yaml` plus creation-target-only `bindings.yaml`; it does not scaffold
evaluation cases.

Supported Kagent inputs are:

- `--namespace`, required `--description`, `--provider-type openai|anthropic`,
  `--model`, `--secret`, optional `--secret-key` (default `api-key`), optional
  credential-free `--base-url`, and optional `--instructions` file;
- `--tools server:tool1,tool2` for at most one same-namespace
  `RemoteMCPServer` binding with an explicit nonempty tool allowlist;
- `--kagent-runtime go|python` (default `go`) for the declarative Agent runtime;
- optional applying `--task`, plus `--out`, `--bundle-path`, `--no-apply`, and
  `--dry-run`.

Kagent create refuses unsupported/Orka-only `--skills`,
`--agent-requests-per-minute`, `--agent-tokens-per-minute`,
`--provider-requests-per-minute`, `--provider-tokens-per-minute`,
`--schema-target`, `--result-service-account`, `--orka-api-service`, and
`--result-port`. `--task` is also refused with `--no-apply`, `--out -`, or
`--dry-run`.

Online create is deliberately create-only. Before the first cluster write, KMX
requires exactly one unambiguous labeled controller Service exposing named
`controller` TCP port 8083 and proves the
controller's exact v0.10.2 version and a release-reported Git prefix of pinned
commit `68df64f671800c37c4204d81ebe0dd66ec35d223`, published controller image
tag/digest identity, current rollout, image ConfigMap, selected Go/Python runtime
image configuration, exact Agent/ModelConfig CRD schemas, that `WATCH_NAMESPACES`
includes the target (or is empty for all namespaces), and the controller
ServiceAccount's required target-namespace RBAC. It also proves the separately
provisioned Secret/key and captures any configured RemoteMCPServer identity,
spec/Secret hash, and discovered tool set. It refuses existing same-name
ModelConfig or Agent objects and the same-name Secret, ServiceAccount,
Deployment, or Service children the controller would overwrite. The model
Secret must not share the Agent name. Both strict server-dry-run responses must
retain the exact reviewed spec and KMX markers, allowing only OpenAI's pinned
`apiFormat: chatCompletions` default. `--dry-run` stops after those online checks
and writes no cluster resource or message.

After those preflights KMX writes the review artifact, creates ModelConfig, and
waits for current-generation `Accepted`; then it rechecks child collisions and
captured dependencies, creates Agent, and waits for current-generation
`Accepted` and `Ready`. Every create response and later live read must retain
the admitted spec and KMX markers. Success also proves the Agent-owned
Deployment and Service, the complete current rollout, and the selected official
v0.10.2 runtime image tag/digest identity. Pre-create cluster checks have a
five-minute budget; each created resource then receives a fresh ten-minute
readiness budget. Before an optional task it additionally proves
the controller-proxied A2A card. KMX never adopts, updates, reconciles, or
deletes an existing Kagent object.

There is no transaction or rollback. A create failure stops later resources and
messages but leaves anything already created. Rerunning after a partial failure
will refuse the existing ModelConfig or Agent, so an operator must inspect the
named resources and deliberately clean up only what should be recreated.
Ambiguous creates are never retried, adopted, or deleted.

`--task` sends one A2A `message/send` after all readiness, workload, image, and
agent-card proof. Agent-card discovery and the send each receive a fresh
five-minute budget. It never retries an ambiguous send. KMX accepts only a strict
matching JSON-RPC response containing an `agent` text message or a completed
task whose answer message has a nonblank ID and the task's exact context ID,
strips unsafe terminal
controls, and prints the sanitized answer. KMX rechecks the Agent UID/generation
and its owned Deployment/Service before and after the send, but A2A itself does
not cryptographically bind returned bytes to that Kubernetes UID. KMX feeds the task prompt to kubectl
on stdin, never argv; it is not written to the artifact, bundle, or receipt.

Kagent persists the full prompt, history, and answer in its database. Upstream
default session retention is unlimited, and Kubernetes audit policy may capture
Service-proxy request and response bodies. A controller configured with
`AUTH_MODE=trusted-proxy` may still be used for creation without `--task`, but
the task path is refused before writes because KMX accepts no Kagent bearer
credential.

After every successful online create, KMX writes a mode-0600
`KagentCreateReceipt` under the bundle's `receipts/` directory. It records the
cluster and resource identities and portable/rendered digests, never prompt or
answer text or system instructions. This receipt does not make the bundle eligible for other lifecycle
commands: `kmx agent lift`, `status`, `evaluate`, console bundle operations, and
interactive `/lift` are currently Orka-only and intentionally refuse Kagent
bundles before target work.

### Editing an agent

`kmx agent edit` is retired; its hidden stub points to kubectl.
`kmx agent create` writes reviewable YAML you own, and a live Orka Agent
is edited as the Kubernetes resource it is:

```bash
kubectl --context <ctx> -n <namespace> edit agents.core.orka.ai <name>
```

`kmx agent show <name> --namespace <ns>` reads it back with the chain it
depends on.

## Interactive chat

```bash
kmx agent chat --interactive --namespace orka-system hello-world-agent
```

`/help`, `/agent`, `/tools`, `/lift`, `/inference`, `/inference-local`,
`/inference-copilot`, `/inference-foundry`, `/retry`, `/verbose-on`,
`/verbose-off`, `/exit` are local controls. Each Orka turn is a fresh Task, so
there is no resumable server-side session and no `--session`. Scanner input
remains supported when raw mode is unavailable; terminal slash completion is
local. Malformed history can be skipped and ordinary
verbose payloads are display-limited; this is not an audit export.

Trusted actor/action labels and indented payloads prevent tool/model prose from
impersonating controls. `[KAIMAHI ROUTE]` shows verified startup configuration,
not an allowed/ledgered receipt: the stream does not carry those receipts.
Possible denial text has unverified provenance; inspect `kmx ledger` for model
refusals. Cap denials file no approval request; recovery is an operator's deliberate
budget change or the UTC month reset. Direct tool activity has no Kaimahi approval path.
These records remain visible with `/tools off`.

Orka chat offers no native approval submission. Tools requiring approval are
unavailable in this client; inspect and configure them through the runtime's
supported operator path instead. A disconnect does not resume or reinvoke a
working Task. Enhanced-input resize stops chat without submitting the current
message and restores terminal state; restart chat to continue. This is a safe
abort, not live reflow or undo of earlier actions. Renderers keep durable
response text and stop uncertain animation after resize.

### Retry limits

There is no one-shot Kagent **chat** transport: the former chat invoke, its
connection-refused/EOF/reset retries and resumable `--session` remain removed.
The separate create-only `--runtime kagent --task` path sends once and never
retries an ambiguous result. Interactive Orka `/retry` explicitly resends; that
does not promise exactly-once execution.

`kmx quickstart` is Orka and does not participate in that policy. It creates one
Task, polls that Task's result over a single context-pinned connection, and never
resubmits: connection or forward loss ends the wait rather than repeating the
model call. A missing or whitespace-only result remains unavailable and is
polled on that same Task; once a nonblank result arrives, output with no printable
content is refused. Neither case resubmits the Task.

## How the plane gets there without a clone

The plane is a nested Go module, so root `go:embed` cannot carry its source.
Outside a checkout, kmx fetches/builds `plane/cmd/kaimahi-proxy` via the Go proxy
at its own revision, packages it on the distroless base and side-loads into kind.
Embedded manifests are applied as committed; no plane image is published.
A checkout wins, `--source <path>` selects one, and `--source -` forces fetch.
Ask `kmx metrics` for `kaimahi_build_info` rather than infer revision from a tag.

The fetched plane build targets Linux. kmx removes shell `GOBIN` for cross-builds;
if Go's environment file still sets it, use `go env -u GOBIN` or a checkout build.
AKS uses ACR instead; see [managed-cluster limitations](aks.md).

## `kmx models add`

```bash
kmx models add house --url http://vllm.demo:8000/v1/responses --classification free
```

Writes three documents: an overlay ConfigMap, proxy egress and server ingress;
no legacy model preset. kmx prints the seam address/CA requirements. Supply the
**whole POST URL**, including path, over in-cluster HTTP. TLS/keyed endpoints
need reviewed committed custody configuration. Explicit `free|metered` is
required; protocol is inferred only from recognized paths, otherwise declared,
and conflicting declarations refuse. Models pulling weights may need deliberate
server egress rather than default none.

Service selectors and post-NAT pod ports come from the live Service;
selector-less Services refuse, and named target ports need `--pod-port`.
Shared selectors affect every matching pod. `--server-egress none|dns|keep`
defaults to none; choose deliberately.

Files use exclusive create and reject credential shapes. The whole existing
overlay carries `resourceVersion` so stale apply conflicts instead of pruning
concurrent work. Only genuine NotFound means no overlay. Committed entries
cannot be overridden. Overlays refuse `credential_file`, `credential_header`,
`internet`, `ca_file`, `extra_headers` and `prices`; these remain reviewed code.
Retired `tool_upstreams` and `standing_constraints` keys refuse even if empty or
null; clean old fragments up deliberately, not by silently discarding them.

The plane validates the table, not the generated policies; Kubernetes checks
those on apply/server dry-run. `--out -` mutates nothing but still validates;
`--no-apply` writes only. Multi-document apply is not transactional and can leave
partial changes. Review selectors and output before trusting the boundary.

Cents budgets refuse unpriced pairs while token budgets can meter them. Admin
contract 2 is required. **Every plane credential can access a configured model
upstream**: there is no per-credential model allowlist.

## Governing model traffic

`kmx govern` is retired; its hidden stub points to `kmx migrate`.
Put an owner-managed application behind the plane with `kmx migrate`, or
issue a credential into a named destination with
`kmx credential issue <name> --secret <secret> --namespace <ns>`. Both paths
share the same pre-issue binding checks, so neither can overwrite a one-time
token, and both refuse a destination namespace that is blank or absent before
anything is minted — there is no default namespace, because a token issued
into a guessed one cannot be recovered. Legacy preset governance is gone with
the legacy lift payload that was its last caller.

It uses cluster access plus the admin bearer on a pod port-forward, not a
public admin Service. Tokens travel in memory/pipes to Secrets. Already-issued
credentials are reconciled, not overwritten; wrong/missing bindings refuse.
An existing Secret with no credential-binding annotation also refuses before issuance.

Tool credential capture is removed. Plane-side model Copilot capture remains
`kmx models credential copilot`: GitHub device login, a private 0600 OAuth cache
and short-lived token exchange without reading credential material from stdin.
It applies egress and restarts an existing proxy. [AKS](aks.md#the-credential-handoff)
gives the explicit-context command. Provider credentials for an onboarded
upstream are `kmx models add`; for plane-side Copilot credentials use
`kmx models credential copilot`. The retired direct-to-Copilot preset's
checkout-only Secret helper is no longer provided.

## Backup, restore, and metrics

`backup` runs pg_dump inside Postgres, no local database client/password exposure.
It writes a unique 0600 temporary file, verifies the dump trailer, then renames;
failure preserves an existing destination. Default: `backups/kaimahi-<UTC>.sql`.
Treat token hashes, budgets and audit history as sensitive database material.

`restore` **replaces all tables**, guarded. It rejects missing trailers before
mutation, scales proxies to zero, loads the dump, and attempts original replica
recovery even after failure. Recovery errors are reported; success is not
promised. An originally stopped plane stays stopped. `metrics` port-forwards
one Ready, non-terminating replica; its name goes to stderr, exposition to stdout.
It does not invent a sum across replicas. See [operations](operations.md).

## What is NOT in `kmx`

Standalone network probes retain checkout paths in [egress](egress.md).
Plane-side Copilot capture and the full lift do not need a checkout handoff.
The tool gateway, tool-governance/capture commands and [workflow runner](workflows.md)
are retired, not checkout alternatives. Use native kmx, with the Makefile only
for retained repository helpers.
