# Kaimahi documentation

**KMX is the Agent Builder CLI. Runtimes execute and govern agents.** Start with
the current creation and lift paths below; use the runtime contract when extending
or comparing implementations.

## Current operator paths

| I want to… | Read |
|---|---|
| Set up the current development CLI and understand prerequisites | [Getting started](getting-started.md) |
| Understand runtime, context, session, inference, lifecycle, and enforcement boundaries | [Runtime contract](runtime-adapters.md) |
| Install Orka, inspect before applying, or see the version actually running | [Orka](orka.md) |
| Author an agent: default native Orka, or explicit create for preinstalled exact Kagent v0.10.2 | [Native Orka create](orka.md#author-an-orka-agent-and-get-an-answer), [CLI contract](kmx.md#kmx-agent-create) |
| Define or validate a portable OCI AgentSuite with bundled or remote ToolProviders and standalone provider sandbox images | [AgentSuite Artifact Specification](agentsuite-spec.md) |
| Review proposed internal contracts connecting suite builds and deployment adapters | [Full-suite deployment contracts](suite-deployment-contracts.md) |
| Lift a marked built agent image to a prepared Kubernetes/AKS target | [Experimental AgentSuite image lift](agentsuite-image-lift.md) |
| Route an existing application's model traffic through Orka | [Migration](migrate.md) |
| Use an existing AKS cluster or provision a disposable one | [AKS](aks.md) |
| Find a command, its safety contract, and supported output modes | [kmx reference](kmx.md) |
| Install a tagged release or understand version and upgrade limits | [Releases](releases.md) |
| Diagnose installation, routing, or existing runtime problems | [FAQ](FAQ.md) |

Installing Orka is not migration. A migrated application's Deployment stays
under its owner's management; the supported migration governs **model
traffic**, not all activity by the application.

Native Orka authoring remains the default and the recommendation in
[orka.md](orka.md). The explicit Kagent v0.10.2 create adapter is a direct,
create-only target for a preinstalled runtime, not a YAML translation over Orka
and not a restoration of the former broad command surface. Whether that narrow
adapter should ever become a general cross-runtime authoring or lifecycle
surface remains open and unsupported. Existing retired commands/manifests and
the removed conversion spike are not evidence of one.

## References for legacy code still present

These documents distinguish the surviving model seam
from retirement pointers. They are not Orka documentation or a platform roadmap.
The plane has three listeners (model 8080, admin 9091, ops 9092); the MCP gateway,
workflows, connector fixtures and all custom approvals/grants are removed.
Ordinary model caps, accounting and reservations remain; `flow`/`watch` read only
the model ledger. Historical requests/grants/audits remain in SQL/backups, not
through the removed APIs. Existing installations need the
[retirement upgrade steps](operations.md#upgrading-after-approval-retirement),
including the all-replica build check and rollback warning.
All twelve SQL migrations and stored data are retained.

| Plane model proxy, metering and budget limits | [Spend](spend.md) |
| Retired gateway and tool onboarding | [Foreign runtime](foreign-runtime.md) |
| Retired custom approvals/grants and preserved history | [Approvals](approvals.md) |
| Attribution and expiring credentials | [Identity](identity.md) |
| Plane NetworkPolicy and residual exposure | [Egress](egress.md) |

The [legacy plane diagram](assets/architecture.svg), with
[Mermaid source](assets/architecture.mmd), is a **historical pre-retirement**
view, including the removed gateway and inbound paths. It is not the current
listener inventory, Orka architecture or the project's future shape.

## Assessments that inform current work

- [Full chat latency profile](chat-performance-profile.md): local, AKS/Foundry
  and Copilot measurements and optimization priorities.
- [Local Foundry inference](local-foundry-inference.md): interactive host inference
  with Azure login, and the separate native Orka integration proposal.

- [Orka composition](reviews/2026-09-09-orka-composition.md): version-qualified
  findings that informed migration; not a current ownership or authoring ruling.
- [Substrate evaluation boundary](reviews/2026-09-10-substrate-evaluation.md):
  scoped research, not a platform substitution decision.

Superseded lane prompts, old platform proposals and retired review snapshots
are not maintained as public documentation. Git retains their history.
