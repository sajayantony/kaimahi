"""Keep Kagent support inside the explicit exact-v0.10.2 create boundary.

kmx intentionally supports one narrow operation against a preinstalled exact
Kagent v0.10.2: offline render and create-only ModelConfig + Agent deployment,
with an optional one-shot A2A task. It still does not install or upgrade the
runtime, restore its old fixed manifests/presets or CLI, expose it through
other commands, or revive the retired gateway and approval implementation.

This is a scoped-support scanner, not a broad word allowlist:

  SCOPED VOCABULARY is the bare name, API group, v1alpha2, ModelConfig,
  RemoteMCPServer, official image namespace, and create runtime selector.
  Those spellings are allowed only in a closed set of production, test,
  current-documentation, and CI-workflow files that implement, describe, or
  prove create. A path
  grants only those named rules; it is not a whole-file bypass. The selector
  additionally needs create context on its own line.

  MULTILINE COMPOUNDS are checked in bounded windows of adjacent physical
  lines. This closes the newline escape for broad claims, command/source
  composition, option structs, installers, and retired operations. A window
  finding must actually span its first and last lines. Exact-line exemptions
  are still matched and credited only against one original physical line, so
  an overlap cannot widen one or make a stale exemption look used.

  CLOSED SURFACES remain refused even in scoped support files: installer and
  demo/preset assets, moving or non-v0.10.2 version claims, old CLI/shim/compat
  packages, up steps and AKS payloads, runtime flags on non-create commands,
  govern/use/edit, and positive claims of broader operation.

WHAT MAY STAY, AND NOTHING ELSE. Exact-line exemptions retain six categories,
each bound to paths where its claim could be true. A category is an argument
for why a line may stay, and the same argument is not available everywhere:

  historical    the changelog and dated reviews are the historical record,
                named as whole files. No current documentation may be
                listed as historical, and a floor below enforces this.
  retirement    exact production lines that refuse retired surfaces
                BY NAME, plus the historical teardown sentinel. A refusal
                has to spell what it refuses, or it refuses nothing. Only
                in the closed set of production files that do the refusing.
  negative      exact lines asserting the runtime is ABSENT: the CI
                tripwires and the bounded test cases. A negative assertion
                is the opposite of support — but only a test or the CI
                tripwires can make one, so a document cannot borrow the
                category to keep an instruction.
  future        exact lines noting an explicitly UNSUPPORTED future: a v1
                authoring surface that is an open question. A note that
                something is not supported is not support — and the line
                or its reason has to SAY so.
  retired-notice  current documentation that explicitly says a named command
                 is gone. An executable surface cannot borrow this exemption.
  fixture         exactly four reviewed official chart pull/install commands in the
                 CI workflow. They waive only installer/retired-asset findings
                 while preparing the disposable test cluster outside KMX; no
                 other path, line, or rule can borrow this category.

The scoped support paths, categories, and waivable rules are duplicated in
code and JSON and must match exactly. Adding a path or rule is therefore a
policy change, not an allowlist convenience.

HOW IT FAILS, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN HOW IT PASSES. A scanner is a
gate that fails OPEN. Every way this one could quietly stop working is refused:

  - an enumeration that produced no files is not a clean tree;
  - files enumerated and none read is not a clean tree;
  - fewer files than the tree is known to have is a shrunken scan;
  - an allowlist entry matching nothing is stale, and a stale allowlist is
    how an exemption outlives the line it was written for;
  - a rule whose pattern stops matching its own example is gone;
  - a rule whose pattern also matches its counterexample is too wide to
    mean anything;
  - an exemption or support entry whose category cannot fit its path is an
    argument borrowed from somewhere it was earned;
  - a support path or waivable rule outside the closed set widens the boundary;
  - every existing support file is scanned directly in selftest, including
    intended files that are still untracked and absent from git ls-files;
  - a whole file declared historical outside the record itself is a
    directory-sized exemption wearing a filename.
